# Zeynep Dağcı CS210-TERM-PROJECT 

Dataset Description

This project uses Netflix viewing history and Spotify streaming history to analyze cross-platform entertainment behavior. The Netflix dataset includes timestamps, titles, genres, and watch durations, while the Spotify dataset provides track details, play durations, skips, and platform information. Together, these datasets enable a comparative analysis of video and audio streaming habits.

Project Idea

The aim is to uncover patterns in entertainment consumption, explore correlations between Netflix genres and Spotify preferences, and build insights for personalized recommendations. Key questions include: How do users allocate time between these platforms? Are there connections between the genres of watched shows and listened music? Can we recommend content across platforms?

Project Plan

In order to find usage trends and cross-platform patterns, the project starts with data cleansing and harmonization and then moves on to exploratory data analysis (EDA). Features like session length, genre preferences, and temporal usage will be engineered for machine learning models. Predictive models will explore user behavior and a recommendation system will suggest content across platforms. The findings will be visualized in dashboards and summarized in a report.


Tools and Technologies

Key tools include Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib), visualization libraries (Plotly, Dash), and data environments like Jupyter Notebook. Interactive dashboards will present insights, supported by machine learning techniques for prediction and recommendation.
